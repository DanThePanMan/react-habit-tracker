# React Habit Tracker

A habit tracking application with useful tools such as creating tasks and deleting tasks, along with search and a graph. 

This application is built with React JS along with Firebase to store data. 

Some good future improvements for this application can be the ability to show the completed task on hover when the user hovers over different colors on the graph, or expand the side bar while the user hovers over it.
